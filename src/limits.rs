//! Rate limiting and concurrency control for sponsored deposits.
//!
//! `/deposit` spends the relayer's ETH on behalf of an unauthenticated caller. The signature binds
//! the amount and destination, so nobody can *steal* a deposit — but nothing in the protocol stops
//! someone submitting a stream of legitimate, worthless deposits and burning gas. These are the
//! controls that must live in-process because they depend on state only this service has: which
//! address a signature actually recovered to, how many submissions are in flight, and what the
//! relayer's balance is.
//!
//! Controls better handled upstream (an API gateway or WAF) are deliberately absent: IP-based
//! limiting, API keys, and TLS termination all belong to a layer that can see the real client.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! The two tiers apply at different points, for different reasons:
//!
//! * **Global** limits run *before* verification. `from` is attacker-controlled at that stage, so
//!   the only meaningful defence is one that ignores claimed identity and just bounds volume.
//! * **Per-address** limits run *after* signature recovery, once `from` is proven. Applying them
//!   earlier would be trivially bypassed by varying `from` on every request.
